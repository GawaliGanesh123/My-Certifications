This repository contains all the certifications I have completed in the C programming language. These certifications have played a significant role in strengthening my understanding of C and its core concepts.
Through these courses, I have gained in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in the following topics:

   Data Types & Operators
   Arrays & Pointers
   Functions & Structures 
  Enumerations (Enums)
  File Handling
  Static & Dynamic Memory Allocation
  Storage Classes
  Logical Problem Solving
  How to build logic while making projects
  Implementing Logic in Data Structures


Each certification helped me build a solid foundation in C, making me more confident and efficient in writing optimized and modular C code.
These certifications not only strengthened my theoretical knowledge but also improved my coding logic and problem-solving approach in C.
